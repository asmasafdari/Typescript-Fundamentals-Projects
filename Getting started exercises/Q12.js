////Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let friend = ["Amir", "Ammar", "Asma", "Alifyah"];
for (let Name of friend) {
    console.log("Hello " + Name + ", How are you doing");
}
